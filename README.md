# media-cube-cd-player

This repo holds scripts, notes, and hacks to make my Raspberry Pi play CDs from an [Apple USB SuperDrive](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD564LL/A/apple-usb-superdrive), with a [Griffin PowerMate](https://griffintechnology.com/powermate-usb-classic-aluminum) USB knob to control playback.
