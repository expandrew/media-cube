"""
State

This is where we handle "state" of playback/mode/volume/etc.

Functions to get/set current "mode"
Functions to reset "mode" back to default (long press for most functions should reset)
Functions to change between "modes" when certain things are already happening (ex. AirPlay is playing and someone puts in a CD; how does that transition work?)
